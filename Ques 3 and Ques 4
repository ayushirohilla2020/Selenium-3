Q3- What are the advantages of TestNG & TestNG annotations?

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use.TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:  unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.

The main advantage of testNG can be listed as follows:
    • Annotations.
    • Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
    • Test that your code is multithread safe.
    • Flexible test configuration.
    • Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
    • Support for parameters.
    • Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
    • Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).
    • Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
    • Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
    • Dependent methods for application server testing.
    • It has different assertions that helps in checking the expected and actual results
    • Detailed (HTML) reports


Advantages Of TestNG Annotations in Selenium:
    • They are easy to understand.
    • You can group test cases using appropriate annotations.
    • You can do parallel test.
    • You can pass extra parameters for annotation.
    • They are strongly typed, so the compiler will completely catch any errors.

Q4- Print the order of TestNG annotations?

Sequence of Execution of the annotations:
    1. BeforeSuite
    2. BeforeTest
    3. BeforeClass
    4. BeforeMethod
    5. Test
    6. AfterMethod
    7. AfterClass
    8. AfterTest
    9. AfterSuite
